### rational operators compares two values and give output as true or false 
c = 10
d = 8
e = 10<8 #less than
print(e)
e = 10>8 #greater than
print(e)
e = 10<=8 # less than equal to
print(e)
e = 10>=8 # greaater than equal to
print(e)
e = 10==8 # equality check
print(e)
e = 10!=8 # not equal 
print(e)
##### logical operator
x = 1
y = 2
z = 3
print(x>y and x<z) 
print(x>y or x<z)
print(not(x>z))

### assignment..... used to assign a value to operator 
l = 4
print(l)
l+=2
print(l)
l-=2
print(l)
l*=4
print(l)
l/=5
print(l)
l%=9
print(l)
l**=10
print(l)
